# Introduction

This is the supplemental material for our submission to Genetic Programming Theory and Practice XX.
This is not intended as a stand-alone document, but as a companion to our manuscript.

## About our supplemental material

As you may have noticed (unless you're reading a pdf version of this), our supplemental material is hosted using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).
We compiled our data analyses and supplemental documentation into this nifty web-accessible book using [bookdown](https://bookdown.org).

The source code/configuration files for this supplemental material can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/amlalejini/phylogeny-informed-evaluation).

Our supplemental material includes the following:

- Data availability (Section \@ref(data-availability))
- GP instruction set (Section \@ref(signalgp-instruction-set))
- Analysis notebooks for each experiment (including source code)
  - Selection scheme diagnostics (Section \@ref(selection-scheme-diagnostic-experiments))
  - Program synthesis problems (Section \@ref(program-synthesis-experiments))
