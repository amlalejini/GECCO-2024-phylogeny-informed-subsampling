# Selection scheme diagnostics

The code in this directory is adapted from Jose Hernandez's implementation of his selection scheme diagnistics: https://github.com/jgh9094/ECJ-2022-suite-of-diagnostics-for-selection-schemes/

NOTE: The diagnostics codebase could very much use a total re-write to cater the code for testing phylogeny-informed evaluation/sampling.
