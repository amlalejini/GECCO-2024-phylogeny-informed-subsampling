# Anonymized supplemental material

This directory contains anonymized supplemental material. When we deanonymize our manuscript (if accepted), our supplemental material will be provided in two alternative forms: (1) as an ebook hosted on GitHub pages and (2) as an archived repository (via Zenodo).
All documents will be more cohesively stitched together in both of these de-anonymized forms.
Additionally, all code and data will be available through the de-anonymized supplemental material.

The R analysis documents are best viewed in HTML format (as provided) through your browser.
