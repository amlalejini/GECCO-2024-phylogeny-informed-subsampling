- Diagnostics:
  - Contradictory objectives
  - Multipath exploration
  - (?Exploitation rate)
  - (?Valley crossing)
- Sampling rates: 1%, 10%, None
- Estimation: ancestor-based
- Depth limit: 8
- Sampling methods: None (full lexicase), down-sampling, indiv-random, phylo-informed

Generations: 50K, each (even for full lexicase, which we'll just use as a baseline)
